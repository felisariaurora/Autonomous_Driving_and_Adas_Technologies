## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Learning model for **2D Semantic Segmentation** from a single RGB camera.

**Context:** In Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), segmentation is a key task to accurately perceive and interpret surroundings. It classifies every pixel in an image into meaningful categories (e.g., road, car, pedestrian).

**Goal:** Develop an algorithm capable of predicting semantic labels for each pixel.
