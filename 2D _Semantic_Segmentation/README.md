#ADAS Project: 2D Semantic Segmentation

## 📖 Introduction
This repository contains the final project for the **ADAS and Autonomous Driving** course. 
The goal is to address a key perception task: **Semantic Segmentation**.

## 🎯 Project Goal
Development of a deep learning-based algorithm able to predict semantic labels for each pixel starting from a single RGB image ($H \times W \times 3$), trained on a dataset with pixel-level annotations.
