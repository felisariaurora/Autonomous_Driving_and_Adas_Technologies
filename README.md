## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

### 📄 `appunti.pdf`
**Complete Course Notes** A comprehensive PDF document containing re-elaborated lecture notes. It covers the entire syllabus, including mathematical formulations for calibration, state estimation, and deep learning architectures applied to automotive tasks.

### 💻 `/2D_Semantic_Segmentation`
**Final Project: 2D Semantic Segmentation for ADAS** This folder contains the source code and resources for the exam project. The goal of the project is to perform semantic segmentation on road scenes to identify drivable areas, obstacles, and lanes.

* **Techniques:** [Inserisci qui, es: Deep Learning / U-Net / ResNet]
* **Frameworks:** [Inserisci qui, es: Python, PyTorch / TensorFlow, OpenCV]
* **Dataset:** [Inserisci qui, es: Cityscapes / KITTI / Custom]
